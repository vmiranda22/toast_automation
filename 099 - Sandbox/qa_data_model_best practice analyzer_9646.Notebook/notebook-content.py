# ## Best Practice Analyzer
# 
# When you run this notebook, the [Best Practice Analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/semantic-link-sempy/sempy.fabric?view=semantic-link-python#sempy-fabric-run-model-bpa) (BPA) will offer tips to improve the design and performance of your semantic model. 
# 
# By default, the BPA checks a set of 60+ rules against your semantic model and summarizes the results. These rules come from experts within Microsoft and the Fabric Community.  
# 
# You’ll get suggestions for improvement in five categories: Performance, DAX Expressions, Error Prevention, Maintenance, and Formatting. 
# 
# ### Powering this feature: Semantic Link
# This notebook leverages [Semantic Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-science/semantic-link-overview), a python library which lets you optimize Fabric items for performance, memory and cost. The "[run_model_bpa](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/semantic-link-sempy/sempy.fabric?view=semantic-link-python#sempy-fabric-run-model-bpa)" function used in this notebook is just one example of the useful [functions]((https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/semantic-link-sempy/sempy.fabric)) which Semantic Link offers.
# 
# You can find more [functions](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-link-labs#featured-scenarios) and [helper notebooks](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-link-labs/tree/main/notebooks) in [Semantic Link Labs](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-link-labs), a Python library that extends Semantic Link's capabilities to automate technical tasks.
# 
# ### Low-code solutions for data tasks
# You don't have to be a Python expert to use Semantic Link or Semantic Link Labs. Many functions can be used simply by entering your parameters and running the notebook.

# #### Learn more about notebooks in Fabric
# Notebooks in Fabric empower you to use code and low-code solutions for a wide range of data analytics and data engineering tasks such as data transformation, pipeline automation, and machine learning modeling.
# 
# * To edit this notebook, switch the mode from **Run** only to **Edit** or **Develop**.
# * You can safely delete this notebook after running it. This won’t affect your semantic model.
# * This notebook uses Python, which is currently a preview experience. For a General Availability experience, you can change the language to PySpark from the language dropdown menu in the Home tab.
#
